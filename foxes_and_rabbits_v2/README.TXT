PROJECT TITLE: foxes and rabbit v2
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: 2nd programming assignment

A predator-prey simulation involving foxes and rabbits in
an enclosed rectangular field.

We use inheritance and interfaces so we provide informations from general classes 
to more specific.

We also added hunters and mountains in the field
so that it has more options and functions.

How to start:
    Create a Simulator object.
    Then call one of:
        + simulateOneStep - for a single step.
        + simulate - and supply a number (say 10) for that many steps.
        + runLongSimulation - for a simulation of 500 steps.
